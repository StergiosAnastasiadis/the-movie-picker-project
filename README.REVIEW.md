### Hints 30-11-2021

1. You can replace anchor elements with buttons in Card & Cart component
2. In header should add the number of total movies from Cart
3. Check if you can improve the form submission functionality
4. After finishing with the corrections try to keep your code clean and write comments only if you need to give an explanation.


**Component Cart
1. createCart is not using props. Try to use more "to the point" names to your values like movie or movieInCart
    because the time that you will need to use props you will have a problem of misunderstanding.
 
**Input Component
1. Try in dropdown menu to use buttons instead anchors.
